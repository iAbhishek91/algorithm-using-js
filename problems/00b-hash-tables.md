# Hash Table

They are called as **hash tables** | **hash maps** | **maps** | **Set** | **ordered maps** | **dictionaries** | **objects** are common name of maps.

- key value pair.

## Complexity

Insert: O(1)
Delete: O(1)
lookup: O(1)
search: O(1)

## Collision

when hash function outputs same hash for two different data. hash table are then extended using **link list** (or other ways) automatically.

Collision will effect performance, both for read and write.

## Map

- Maintains insertion orders
- anything can be key, in obj only strings are allowed

## Sets

- unique
- it stores only the keys
