# Graph

- It's a network **biggest graph - internet**. and great to solve networking problems.
- Each item is called a node and a vertex.
- Similar to linked list, edges are used to connect nodes.
- Graphs have variety of shapes
  - *all link list are graph*.
  - *all trees are graph*.

## Characteristics and Types

- **Directed graph**:
- **Undirected graph**:
- **Weighted graphs**: each edge have a weighted | *popular: shortest path first.*
- **Unweighted graph**:
- **Cyclic**:
- **Acyclic**: nodes are connected in a circular fashion. (traversing in one way from AT LEAST one node will lead you back to the same node.)
